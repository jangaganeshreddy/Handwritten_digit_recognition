# Handwritten Digit Recognition

## Project Overview 
This project involves the development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits. 
The model was trained on the MNIST dataset, which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (0-9).

## DataSet Used
MNIST Dataset

## Algorithm Used
Convolutional Neural Network

## How to Use
1. Open the GUI application.
2. Use your mouse to draw a digit on the white canvas.
3. Once you've drawn the digit, click the 'Predict' button.
4. The application will then use the trained CNN model to predict the digit based on your drawing and display the result on the GUI.
